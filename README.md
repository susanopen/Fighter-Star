Welcome! This is the Fighter Star program repository. My name is Susan. I am an independent journalist in China 
and interested in civil technology and digital rights.

In China, more and more independent writers and citizen journalists emerge and conduct high-quality articles, but lack of promotion channel and fund for their continuous works. Fighter Star platform try to engage more readers and organizations to support them by crowdfunding; at the same time, the readers and donators can enjoy the constant high-quality articles and reports. If it can become a system, it will be win-win.

There are vast needs of readers to seek high quality and credible information and reports due to the difficult internet environment, and they are also willing to pay the bill for great works. It means challenges and opportunities. So this program plan to deal with how to create the Readers Support Independent Creativity mechanism in China.

My partner and I will start with a draft reading and crowdfunding website, maybe you can see it as a demo, and we also use some new tools and cooperate with other programs at the same time, we have communicated with some different kinds of programs and inspired by them. Finally, we believe we can find the best way to achieve it. 

We call for more experts and volunteers who are good at or interested in crowdfunding platform and Front-end programmer, as well as promotion.
